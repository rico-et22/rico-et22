### Hi there 👋
I'm a young and passionate front-end web developer coding with technologies like React, Next.js, Vue and Nuxt.

I love experimenting with new technologies, especially creating JAMStack-based websites with GraphQL-powered CMSs like GraphCMS and Contentful.

Since May 2020, I've been working at Forkflow, where I with my teammates developed [TheVeganKind Supermarket](https://thevegankindsupermarket.com), the biggest UK-based store for online vegan shopping.

**I'm open to any new job opportunities**, if you have one, feel free to contact me 😃
